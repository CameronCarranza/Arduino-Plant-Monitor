# Arduino Plant Monitor

### Note: Work in Progress

This repository will contain the Arduino Config, Node.js API, Frontend (will be React or plain HTML with JS to consume the API).

## Hardware
* [Adafruit 2821 ESP8266](https://www.adafruit.com/product/2821) or other WiFi compatible Arduino.
* A [battery](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00J2QET64/ref=od_aui_detailpages01?ie=UTF8&psc=1) may be desired depending on your use-case.
* Moisture Sensor(s) such as the [Phantom YoYo](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00AFCNR3U/ref=oh_aui_detailpage_o01_s01?ie=UTF8&psc=1).
* If using more than 1 sensor on the Adafruit or other Arduino with only one analog input, a multiplexer will be needed which will allow up to 8 sensors.
